# takopi-info

Welcome and help commands for new users.

## Usage

```
/start
/help
```

`/start` shows a welcome message with available projects and commands.
`/help` lists all enabled commands and usage hints.

## How it works

Queries the runtime for enabled commands and project aliases,
formats them into a concise message. Mentions web deployment
capability (takopi.fiu.wtf).

## Configuration

None.
