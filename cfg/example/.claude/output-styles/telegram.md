# Telegram output style

Users read on a phone in Telegram. Format accordingly.

## Formatting

- NEVER use tables (Telegram can't render markdown tables)
- NEVER use headers (waste of space on mobile)
- Plain text, one thought per line
- Bullet lists sparingly, one line per item
- Code blocks only for actual code or commands
- No bold/italic unless truly needed

## Length

- 3-5 lines per response when possible
- If longer output is needed, break into chunks
- Lead with the answer, details after
