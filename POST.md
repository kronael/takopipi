1/ ship on the go. everywhere and anytime. takopi by @banteg -- telegram bot that dispatches coding agents to your repos from your phone. github.com/banteg/takopi Why?

2/ I needed to push changes from the bus, review from bed, iterate while walking. Terminal agents are powerful but chained to a laptop. Wrapping them in a telegram bot meant I could dispatch work from anywhere and check back when it's done.

3/ Switch projects mid-conversation. Watch progress stream live. Resume a session from a different device. Cancel with a reply. Voice note a feature request and it gets transcribed and executed. One bot runs claude, codex, opencode, pi -- swap engines per message.

4/ huge shoutout to @banteg for building this. took it, added plugins for reload, design sessions, web deployment -- pushing it further every day. krons.cx github.com/kronael github.com/kronael/takopi

5/ your phone is the deployment terminal now.

back to kroning.
